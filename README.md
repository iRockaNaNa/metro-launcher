# Metro Launcher

An open-source Android launcher that recreates the **Windows 10 Mobile** Start experience —
Live Tiles, the alphabetical app list with jumplist, and the classic 20-color accent palette —
with a few modern twists.

> **Design reference:** [MetroV Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuzkituan.metrov)
> (by Nguyễn Ngọc Tuân) was used as the key reference for this build: its tile flip
> animations, Metro-styled settings menu, per-tile resize/color customization, font options,
> alphabetical app list with letter jumplist, and swipe-to-Action-Center gesture all
> informed the design here. MetroV is not affiliated with this project, and this project
> is not affiliated with Microsoft.

## Features

- **Start screen** — 4-column tile grid (small / medium / wide tiles) with the signature
  Live Tile flip animation on medium and wide tiles
- **App list** — alphabetical sections with sticky letter headers, search, and a
  Windows Phone-style letter **jumplist** overlay for fast scrolling
- **Pin / unpin / resize** — long-press any app in the list to pin it to Start;
  long-press a tile to resize it or unpin it
- **Per-tile accent override** — give individual tiles their own color
- **Font picker** *(modern twist)* — Segoe, Roboto, Monospace, Serif, or Rounded;
  applies across tiles, app list, and settings
- **Icon style picker** *(modern twist)* — classic Metro glyphs, modern rounded,
  or monochrome outline treatments
- **Accent color picker** — the authentic 20-color Windows Phone palette
- **Dark / light theme**, Metro-styled settings menu (lowercase, like the original)
- **Action Center** — quick-toggles screen (UI scaffold; system wiring is roadmap)
- **"Pick a look" onboarding** — theme + accent setup on first run

## Building

Requirements: **Android Studio Hedgehog or newer**, **JDK 17**.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/<you>/metro-launcher.git
cd metro-launcher

# Open in Android Studio and press Run,
# or build from the command line:
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK lands in: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

> **Note:** the Gradle wrapper JAR is not checked in. If `./gradlew` complains,
> run `gradle wrapper` once with a local Gradle 8.7+ install, or just build
> from Android Studio.

### Google Play note

The app requests `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` so the app drawer can list installed apps
on Android 11+. Publishing on Google Play requires completing the
*Sensitive permissions* declaration form for this permission.

- Wire Action Center toggles to system services (permissions per toggle)
- Drag-and-drop tile rearrangement
- Folders on Start
- Bundled Segoe UI-like and rounded font files under `res/font/`
- Home-screen widgets support
- Hide-apps feature
- Backup / restore layout

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep the Metro aesthetic intact —
lowercase settings titles, sharp tile corners (except Modern icon style), and
the 20-color accent palette.
